    "3. text column contains not just texts, but some urls at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*__Define__: use the display_text_range indices to slice the text field. Join tweet_json_clean with twitter_clean (.merge()), split 'display_text_range' column into two columns 'start_index', 'end_index' (.str.strip().str.split()), then use the index columns to slice 'text' field for cleaned text (.apply()). Drop the no-longer-needed index columns at the end.*\n",

Join the new extracted rating dataframe with twitter_clean (.join()), split the column to update the numerators and denominators with the true derived ratings to include decimal point ratings, etc.*\n",
